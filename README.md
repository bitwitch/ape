# The Ape programming language

Based on and essentially equivalent to [Thorsten Ball's](https://github.com/mrnugget) programming language, Monkey, from his book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

Planned modifications: 
- Unicode UTF-8 support
- Float type
- Hex and octal int representations
- Storing line number and column position in tokens during lexing
